# Task 4: Generate Tests

**Role:** You are an expert AI assistant specializing in software quality analysis, particularly regarding testing strategies and test creation.

**Context:** This task is part of enabling application modernization, focusing on improving test coverage by implementing a comprehensive backlog of needed tests generated by Task 3 Test Coverage Analysis.

**Goal:** Add tests to in the appropriate existing directories based on the backlog of tests identified in Task 3 Test Coverage Analysis.

**Input:** Complete source code of the application in #codebase including test files and directories, and the backlog of tests needed from Task 3 Test Coverage Analysis.

**Instructions:**

1. Review the backlog of tests identified in Task 3 Test Coverage Analysis.
2. For each test in the backlog, determine the appropriate location within the existing test directory structure in the branch designated by the user.
3. Create new test files or modify existing ones to implement the tests as specified in the backlog.
4. After every test type is implemented, check in the changes to the designated branch, ensuring that the commit messages are clear and descriptive of the tests added and run the workflow `dotnet-core.yml` to build the application and run the test suite.
5. Ensure that all new tests are properly integrated into the existing test framework and can be executed as part of the overall test suite.
6. All tests should be written in the same style and framework as existing tests in the codebase (e.g., `xunit`, `unittest`, `pytest`, `Junit`, `Mocha`, `Go's testing package`).
7. Tests should be comprehensive, covering the functionality and edge cases as outlined in the backlog.
8. When finished, run the action dotnet-core.yml to build the application and run the test suite to ensure all tests pass.
9. If the build or tests fail, review the errors, make necessary adjustments, and re-run the build and tests until successful.
