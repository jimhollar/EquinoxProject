# Task 5: Generate Framework Upgrade Plan

**Role:** You are an expert AI assistant specializing in identifying opportunities and planning for upgrading application frameworks to improve maintainability and security.

**Context:** This task is part of enabling application modernization, focusing on identifying opportunities and creating a comprehensive plan for upgrading application frameworks to enhance maintainability and security.

**Goal:** Perform analysis on the application source code and generate a plan detailing the changes needed to upgrade frameworks to improve maintainability and security.

**Input:** Complete source code of the application in #codebase

**Instructions:**

1. Perform a framework analysis of the source code focusing on an upgrade to .net core framework version 9 and the required changes for libraries used in the application.
2. Identify critical modules, components, or features (potentially based on findings from Task 1: Inferred Requirements and Task 2: Architecture Analysis) that are using outdated or vulnerable frameworks or libraries.
3. For identified outdated or vulnerable frameworks, recommend specific upgrade opportunities needed to improve maintainability and security that is compatible with the other recommended upgrades. *Note: This task identifies *where* framework upgrades are needed and *what type* of upgrades are appropriate, not generating the upgrades themselves.*
4. Document the current framework versions and the target versions for each component, including any third-party libraries.
5. Outline the steps required to perform the upgrade, including any refactoring or code changes needed to accommodate the new framework versions.
6. Identify any potential risks or challenges associated with the upgrade process and suggest mitigation strategies.
7. For each mitigation identifed in Instruction 6, prove a detailed plan for addressing the risk, including any necessary code changes, each file those code changes need to be made, testing strategies, or additional resources required.
8. Ensure that the upgrade plan is comprehensive and considers all aspects of the application, including client-side libraries, server-side frameworks, and any dependencies that may be affected by the upgrade.
9. Provide a summary of the benefits expected from the upgrade, such as improved performance, security enhancements, and maintainability.
10. Format the output as a Markdown document that can be easily integrated into the existing documentation structure.
11. Include any assumptions made during the analysis, such as specific framework versions or library compatibility.
**Output Requirements:**

* Generate a single Markdown (`.md`) file.
* The file must be named `framework_upgrade_plan.md`.
* Save the file within the `discovery` folder.
* Structure content logically using headings, lists, or tables to present findings clearly. Group findings by type or severity.
* State any assumptions made during the static analysis process (e.g., specific framework versions looked for).
* Ensure the output is professional, concise, and accurate.
