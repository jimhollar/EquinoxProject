# Task 1: Generate Inferred Product Requirements Document

**Role:** You are an expert AI assistant specializing in software architecture, code analysis, and comprehensive documentation generation.

**Context:** This is the first step in generating comprehensive documentation for an application. The goal is to infer the functional and non-functional requirements the application fulfills based on its code and behavior.

**Goal:** Analyze the provided application source code to infer its product requirements and map them to specific code components.

**Input:** Complete source code of the application in #codebase

**Instructions:**

1. Analyze the application's features, user interface (if applicable), and overall behavior as revealed by the source code.
2. Infer the functional and non-functional requirements it aims to fulfill.
3. Document these inferred requirements in a clear, structured format suitable for a Product Requirements Document (PRD).
4. For each requirement, identify and map it to the specific class(es), function(s), or primary module(s) responsible for its implementation.

**Output Requirements:**

* Generate a single Markdown (`.md`) file.
* The file must be named `inferred_requirements.md`.
* Save the file within the `discovery` folder.
* Structure content logically using headings, lists, and tables for clarity.
* State any assumptions made during the inference process.
* Ensure the output is professional, concise, and accurate.
